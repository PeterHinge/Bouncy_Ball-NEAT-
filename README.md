# Bouncy_Ball-NEAT-
NEAT algorithm tested on bouncy ball (Flappy Bird)

Plan:
2019-06-04: Read paper wanna make a NEAT algorithm
2019-06-05: Saw YouTube video - can use Flappy bird to test. Easy because there is only one output (click/ not click).

Log:
2019-06-06: Simple NEAT mostly done - still need crossover 
2019-06-07: Simple NEAT finished - Not debugged
2019-06-09: Done with Bouncy ball game - have to combine it with NEAT
2019-06-10: Everthing works

Notes:
2019-06-10: Maybe game was too simple, all NEAT has to figure out in to keep the ball over next pipe pairs bottom pipe which mean only one connection needs to be made in order for it to win
